# OpenEMR Features Summary


///
DO NOT DELETE
Prompt:
Can you summarize the files that you changed to create the new feature, and include a very brief 1 liner on the changes you made in each file. 
Also include a high level summary of what the feature is and how it integrates into the codebase. 
Add this summary to a new .md file in @/_docs called features summary. I want the summary to breif, crisp and succint. I do not want all comprehensive details recorded, only the key details needed to understand what the feature is and how it works inside the codebase.

Feature #1
## Voice Recording & Transcription (MVP)

### Overview
Simple voice recording feature that allows users to record audio in the "Reason for Visit" field and automatically transcribe it using OpenAI Whisper API. Recording happens client-side with automatic format detection, transcription occurs server-side following OpenEMR AJAX patterns.

### Integration
- **Location**: New Patient Encounter Form → Reason for Visit section
- **Trigger**: Button always visible, validates API key when pressed
- **Flow**: Browser audio recording → auto-format detection → server upload → OpenAI Whisper API → text insertion

### Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `library/globals.inc.php` | Added encrypted OpenAI API key configuration field |
| `interface/forms/newpatient/whisper_simple.php` | Created AJAX endpoint following OpenEMR patterns with proper session handling |
| `interface/forms/newpatient/templates/newpatient/partials/common/fields/_reason-for-visit.html.twig` | Added voice recording UI with adaptive audio format support and error handling |

### Technical Details
- **Audio Formats**: Auto-detects browser capabilities (WebM, WAV, MP3, M4A, OGG)
- **API Key Sources**: .env file, environment variables, or OpenEMR globals config
- **Security**: CSRF protection via `CsrfUtils::csrfNotVerified()`, file size limits (25MB)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks with user-friendly messages
- **AJAX Pattern**: Follows standard OpenEMR AJAX endpoint conventions

Feature #2
## Voice Transcription Integration Fix

### Overview
Fixed existing AI transcription template to properly integrate with OpenAI Whisper API and place transcribed text directly into the "Reason for Visit" field instead of creating separate AI summary forms.

### Integration
- **Location**: Patient Encounter Form → Adjacent to Reason for Visit field
- **Trigger**: "Record & Transcribe" button with recording timer and status indicators
- **Flow**: Voice recording → OpenAI Whisper → preview → add/replace text in Reason for Visit field

### Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `interface/forms/newpatient/templates/newpatient/partials/common/fields/_ai-transcription.html.twig` | Fixed endpoint URL to use whisper_simple.php and modified JavaScript to place transcription in Reason for Visit textarea |

### Technical Details
- **Endpoint**: Uses existing `/interface/forms/newpatient/whisper_simple.php`
- **User Actions**: Add to existing text or replace entire Reason for Visit content
- **UI Features**: Recording timer, status badges, preview with action buttons
- **Integration**: Directly manipulates Reason for Visit textarea via DOM
- **Position**: Strategically placed adjacent to Reason for Visit field as requested

Feature #3
## AI Summary Form Integration

### Overview
Created a dedicated AI Summary form that automatically captures voice transcriptions and displays them in the encounter Summary tab. Voice recordings are now saved as structured form data rather than just being inserted into text fields.

### Integration
- **Location**: Encounter Summary Tab → AI Summary section (automatically created)
- **Trigger**: Voice transcriptions automatically create AI Summary form entries
- **Flow**: Voice recording → Whisper transcription → AI Summary form creation → Display in Summary tab

### Files Created

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `interface/forms/ai_summary/table.sql` | Database schema for form_ai_summary table with transcription storage |
| `interface/forms/ai_summary/info.txt` | Form registration information for OpenEMR registry |
| `interface/forms/ai_summary/new.php` | Form creation endpoint (placeholder for future use) |
| `interface/forms/ai_summary/save.php` | Form data processing and persistence |
| `interface/forms/ai_summary/view.php` | Individual form viewing interface |
| `interface/forms/ai_summary/report.php` | **[CRITICAL]** Summary tab display function `ai_summary_report()` |

### Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `interface/forms/newpatient/whisper_simple.php` | Added `saveTranscriptionToAiSummaryForm()` function and automatic form creation on successful transcription |

### Database Integration

| Table/Action | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| `form_ai_summary` | Stores voice transcriptions with metadata (model used, processing status, timestamps) |
| `registry` table entry | Registers AI Summary as official OpenEMR form type |
| `forms` table entries | Links each transcription to specific patient encounters via `addForm()` |

### Technical Details
- **Database**: MariaDB 11.8 via Docker container (port 8320)
- **Database Setup**: Used `docker exec development-easy-mysql-1 mariadb` to execute SQL directly in container, avoiding need for local MySQL/PHP installation
- **Form Pattern**: Follows OpenEMR standard form structure with new.php, save.php, view.php, report.php
- **Summary Display**: Uses `ai_summary_report($pid, $encounter, $cols, $id)` function called by forms.php
- **Data Flow**: whisper_simple.php → form_ai_summary table → forms table registration → Summary tab display
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback - transcription still works even if form creation fails
- **Security**: Follows OpenEMR patterns with CSRF protection and ACL integration
